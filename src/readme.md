## Welcome to the Src folder for the Gohugo Theme


You may never have to touch anything in this folder. It's here in case you want to more deeply customize your styles.

This theme uses the [Tachyons CSS Library](http://tachyons.io/). It's about 15kb gzipped, highly modular, and each class is atomic so you never have to worry about overwriting your styles.
